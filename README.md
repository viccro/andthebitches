=============
Our strategy for this 6.270 competition was very simple:
 * Drive to a waypoint en route to the back wall, so as not to clip the obstacles in the center of the course
 * Drive to the back wall, gaining exploration points
 * Ensure that the robot is facing this back wall, and the lever in front of it
 * Raise and lower our servo-controlled arm repeatedly, in an attempt to dispense as many rings as possible
 * Disregard any rings that we have dispensed, and keep trying to push the lever to dispense more
